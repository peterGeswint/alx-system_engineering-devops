As a third-year software development student, I find it fascinating how much happens behind the scenes when you type a URL like https://www.google.com into your browser and hit Enter. Let’s break it down step by step to understand this process, from DNS requests to database interactions.

1. DNS Request
First, your browser needs to translate www.google.com into an IP address so it knows where to send the request.

Browser Cache: The browser checks if it has recently accessed this site.
OS Cache: If not, it checks your operating system’s cache.
Router Cache: If still not found, it queries your router’s cache.
ISP’s DNS Server: If the IP address is still unknown, your ISP’s DNS server is asked.
Recursive Lookup: If needed, your ISP's DNS server queries other DNS servers until it finds the IP address for www.google.com.
2. Establishing a TCP/IP Connection
Once the IP address is found, your browser sets up a connection using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) over IP (Internet Protocol).

Three-Way Handshake: This process involves:
SYN: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
ACK: Your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back, completing the connection setup.
3. Firewall
Throughout this connection setup, the data passes through several firewalls.

Client-Side Firewall: Your device’s firewall checks outgoing requests.
Network Firewall: Your network (or router) firewall also checks the traffic.
Server-Side Firewall: The request then passes through Google’s firewall, ensuring it's legitimate.
4. HTTPS and SSL/TLS Handshake
Because the URL starts with https, the connection should be secure, using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

SSL/TLS Handshake: The browser and server exchange encryption keys and agree on encryption methods.
Certificate Exchange: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser for verification.
Session Keys: Both parties generate session keys to encrypt the data.
5. Load Balancer
Big websites like Google use load balancers to handle traffic efficiently.

Traffic Distribution: The load balancer distributes incoming requests to multiple servers based on specific algorithms (e.g., round-robin).
6. Web Server
The web server receives the HTTP request and processes it.

Request Handling: The web server interprets the request, checks for static content (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and gets ready to serve it.
7. Application Server
For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to an application server.

Processing Dynamic Content: The application server runs code (often in languages like Python, Java, or Node.js), interacts with other services, and prepares a response.
8. Database Interaction
If the request needs data (like search results), the application server interacts with a database.

Query Execution: The application server sends a query to the database.
Data Retrieval: The database processes the query and returns the data to the application server.
Data Formatting: The application server formats the data into a response (e.g., JSON, HTML) and sends it back to the web server.
9. Sending the Response
The web server receives the response and sends it back through the load balancer.

Load Balancer: The load balancer forwards the response to your device.
Encryption: The response is encrypted using the SSL/TLS session keys.
TCP/IP Packets: The response is broken into packets and sent over the internet to your device.
10. Rendering the Page
Finally, your browser receives the response and starts rendering the webpage.

HTML Parsing: The browser parses the HTML.
Resource Requests: Additional resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) are requested and fetched.
Page Rendering: The browser builds the Document Object Model (DOM) and renders the page for you to see.
Conclusion
Typing a URL and pressing Enter kicks off a series of intricate processes. From DNS lookups and TCP/IP connections to SSL/TLS handshakes and database queries, these steps ensure you can access websites quickly and securely. Understanding this process highlights the sophisticated technology that powers our everyday internet use.
